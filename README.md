# Sonic Heroes: Fixed Edition
Sonic Heroes' Windows Port is known for its bugs, glitches, issues... it was never the perfect system for everybody, which tend to make people either suffer with how the game works and looks or unfortunately migrate to the GameCube port. From elements from prototypes, to messed up code, to even wrong assets, SH felt like it waas unpolished the more you look at it upclose.

Luckily, there is a solution - Sonic Heroes: Fixed Edition! This mod is a compilation of code-based or graphical fixes, for a better gameplay experience and polished material. It comes with restorations, improvements, some enhancements and additions. Every single detail mattered to make this half of your experience better.

## Installation
Simply install the mod manually or via 1-Click Install. Once you have it on the mod loader, make total sure you move SH:FE to the very top of the list. Fixed Edition should always come first before any other mod. And now it's just saving and launching the game - simple!

## Wiki
There is a [wiki](http://github.com/raphaeldrewboltman/sh-fixed-edition/wiki) (***WiP!***) that tells and shows each fix included in this mod, divided by code-based and filesystem fixes done for the game and featuring comparison images. As well as a subdivision for missing fixes - these are some that aren't containg in SH:FE and with time will be brought to it in future updates.

## Issues
Found any issues on the mod, or found something on a port that can be for this mod? Feel free to write an issue on GitHub. Make sure it's not repetitive compared to other issues, and to check the wiki so you don't write any duplicates.
